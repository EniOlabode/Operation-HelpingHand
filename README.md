# Operation-HelpingHand
Many high school students find it difficult to choose a college major or career path, frequently due to having little access to individualized counseling and exposure to various areas. Current remedies, such as quick counseling sessions and general aptitude testing, are inadequate. Because of this, about one-third of college students switch their majors at least once, which results in lost time, increased expenses, and a later graduation date. By addressing this issue, we can improve educational results and career readiness by empowering students to make educated decisions.
